Discontinued shopping list app for Windows Phones. It currently features N-nested categories, item addition/deletion, and an intuitive UI, *but* its implementation is horrible because I wrote it before realizing that data binding existed. Also, I finally (and inevitably) switched to Android, haha...

Will write an Android version and post the link here when I get the chance!
